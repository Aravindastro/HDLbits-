**#365days of Verilog from beginner to RTL Level**
# HDLbits 
It is meant to serve as a learning resource and my personal log of progress in mastering RTL (Register Transfer Level) design using Verilog.

Practice problems and solutions from HDLBits — Verilog exercises for mastering digital design using Hardware Description Languages.

# HDLbits Practice – Verilog Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/) online problem set, a comprehensive platform for learning and practicing digital logic design using **Verilog HDL**.



HDLBits is highly recommended for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to strengthen their grasp of RTL design, combinational and sequential logic, FSMs, and Verilog programming.
